        <p>Human beings are fragile things, don't you think?</p>
        <p>Skin, so soft it can be cut by paper</p>
        <p>Bones, so brittle a light bend can break them</p>
        <p>Eyeballs, so sensitive looking at the sun can damage them</p>
        <p>And don't even get me started on The Brain, feelings damageable by mere words</p>
        <p>I find it fascinating, almost like playthings</p>
        <p>Dilara's body not the first</p>
        <p>Many more have been before, many more will come after</p>
        <p>Where do you think Gep went?</p>
