        <p>Human beings are fragile things, don't you think?</p>
        <p>Skin, so soft it can be cut by paper</p>
        <p>Bones, so brittle a light bend can break them</p>
        <p>Eyeballs, so sensitive looking at the sun can damage them</p>
        <p>And don't even get me started on The Brain, feelings damageable by mere words</p>
        <p>I find it fascinating, almost like playthings</p>
        <p>Dilara's body not the first</p>
        <p>Many more have been before, many more will come after</p>
        <p>Where do you think Gep went?</p>
        <p>Even though i'd rather not get caught, i do like myself a little game</p>
        <p>Find out who i am, follow my breadcrumbs, if you win, turn me in.</p>
        <p>But run out of time, and Kenneth is next</p>
        <p>Your first clue finds itself at the broken ruins of a holographic machine, ditched in our school, never to be repaired</p>
